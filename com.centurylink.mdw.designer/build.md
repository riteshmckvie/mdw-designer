# Steps for Building and Publishing MDW Designer Plug-In:

In com.centurylink.mdw.designer:
 - Update mdwDesignerVersion in gradle.properties

Commit and push these changes to Git remote

Perform Jenkins Builds :
 - MDW55 - Build
 - MDW6-Build (to pull the latest docs)
 - Designer Build
 - Designer Publish (or Designer Preview)

Publish to the Update Site on GitHub:
 - Download the updateSite artifacts from the Jenkins workspace
 - Commit them to mdw6/docs/designer/updateSite on GitHub (and remove any old ones).    
 - Other plugins required in com.centurylink.mdw.designer.feature/feature.xml should already be present.
   If versions have changed, the newer versions may need to be uploaded (esp. cucumber.eclipse).
    
Test updating Eclipse (Mars/Neon) to the new build.
